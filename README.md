jquery.smoothState.js-demo
==========================

this is a demo page for jquery.smoothState.js plugin

This site handles page transitions with different enter and exit animations. It uses following plugins:

- smoothState.js (with jquery) - http://weblinc.github.io/jquery.smoothState.js/
- prefixfree - http://lea.verou.me/prefixfree/
- offcanvas menu built with help of http://scotch.io/tutorials/off-canvas-menus-with-css3-transitions-and-transforms
- hamburger menu button is built based on http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/navicon-transformicons/

I don't claim, that this is the cleanest code ever, so I will be thankful for any improvement suggestions.
